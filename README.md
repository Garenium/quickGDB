# quickGDB

The quickGDB allows a quick startup time for debugging C and C++ files with gdb. If you want layout src to start up automatically without all the hassle googling and wasting time, then this is the file that you may need. 

Steps:

1. Download the file quickGDB and rename it to .gdbinit in your home directory.

That should be it.

Note: GDB does not *run* automatically, you only need to type ``start``. ``break main`` is already done for you.
